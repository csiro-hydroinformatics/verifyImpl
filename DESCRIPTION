Title: Tools to verify the correct implementation of model simulation
Version: 0.5-1
Date: 2014-12-23
Author: Jean-Michel Perraud
Maintainer: Jean-Michel Perraud <jean-michel.perraud@csiro.au>
Description: This is a collection of tools to help verifying the correctness
    and/or fitness for use of model implementations. While some behaviors can
    and must be captured in unit tests, the process of porting or refactoring
    model code more often than not requires human judgment as to the adequate
    model correctness, in the process of defining repeatable unit tests.
    Currently the tools in this package are dealing with temporal simulations
    with point time series model states.
