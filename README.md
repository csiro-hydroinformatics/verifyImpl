verifyImpl
==========

This is a collection of tools to help verifying the correctness and/or fitness for use of model implementations. While some behaviors can and must be captured in unit tests, the process of porting or refactoring model code more often than not requires human judgment as to the adequate model correctness, in the process of defining repeatable unit tests. 

Currently the tools in this package are dealing with temporal simulations with point time series model states.
